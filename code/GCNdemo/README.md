# Intro

Keras-based implementation of graph convolutional networks for semi-supervised classification and here is my [translation](https://muyuuuu.github.io/2020/06/16/GCN/).

- `cora` : The trainset.
- `train.py`: `python train.py` will run the program.
- `utils.py`: load data, symmetrically normalized adjacency matrix, etc.
